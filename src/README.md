this project will convert your two layer json data to any language which is listed.
this has been made to overcome translate issue. which free tool like google, michrosoft are prvidong translate upto 5000 words but does not support translation of json data. this will only support two layered json data.

ex. of two layer Json data :

Input :
{"hello":{"Hello":"hello"}}

Output:
{ "hello": { "Hello": "Ciao" }}

this has made to only translate value , but not the property name.
this has been  tasted with as larg as 15000 word json file.
